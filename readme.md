# FreeAlgebra
## An autodifferentiable libary for symbolic algebra

`FreeAlgebra` is originally designed for Grassmann 
integration and Clifford algebra. 

It allows one to define finite freely generated algebras by specifying 
the commutation relations between generators and conjugation relations. 

Supports non-representable algebras.
