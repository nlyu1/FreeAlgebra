# FreeAlgebra
## Flexible, high-performance algebraic computations

`FreeAlgebra` is a library designed for symbolic manipulation of 
custom-defined algebraic objects. Originally designed for Grassmann 
integration and Clifford algebra. 

It allows one to define finite freely generated algebras by specifying 
the commutation relations between generators and conjugation relations.
